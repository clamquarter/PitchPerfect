# PitchPerfect
<h3>Summary</h3>
PitchPerfect is an app project from the Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree Program. It's a fun app that allows the user to record a voice memo and change their voice on playback.

<h3>What I Learned</h3>
<ul>
<li>How to implement AVAudioRecorder.</li>
<li>The dangers of hard-coding alignments.</li>
<li>How to use auto-layout to create a dynamic UI layout.</li>
<li>How to troubleshoot IBOutlets/IBActions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What I'd Do Differently</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add an export feature to allow users to share/down;oad their recording. </li>
<li>Use SwiftUI, of course!</li>
<li>Add a save feature to allow users to keep multiple recordings.</li>
</ul>
